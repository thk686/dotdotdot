Description: The dots package assists function author in passing the elipsis
    ("...") argument to sub-functions. The elipsis argument can be passed to a set
    of subfunctions and only the appropriate components of the elipsis argument will
    be passed to each function. The elipsis argument can also be passed sequentially
    with each subfunction consuming elements of the argument-set at each stage.
